                <h2>Research Question:</h2> 
                <h3> <i> To solve the problem of finding room/apt/house? </i></h3>
              </p>
              There are startups like <i>Nooklyn, Streeteasy, Trulia</i> that are trying to solve this problem. But are they actually solving this problem?
              <p>
                <h3>Story behind this research question:</h3>
                As I was moving to New York to pursue my master's, I was struggling to find a room online for myself. There are many websites like Airbnb, Hotel websites, and many others like, Nooklyn, Streeteasy, Roomster, Trulia, Facebook groups, etc. which are helping you find the rooms, apt or house. I did the same. I explored these sites.
              </p>
              <p>
                  <i>First Problem:</i> I was not able to find the room that fits my budget.<br>
                  Some of these websites have beautiful rooms, but they were so expensive. The ones that fit my budget was far from my school. Then, somehow, after exploring a lot, I found so many <b><i>Fake Listings</i></b>. Some listings that were in my budget did not have any Images/pictures of the room/house or some who have the images, but not the description or details.
                  It was frustrating and annoying. I even bought a subscription($25/mo) of Roomster app, thinking of it might help. But no luck. Also, I found some people doing fraud, asking for money in advance and saying will give you keys, once you reach here.
                  <i>P.S. I was searching for rooms online in my country.</i>
               </p>
              <p>
                Then, after all of this, I finally decided to book my room for a month through Airbnb. I have used Airbnb a couple of times, and I was satisfied with the experience. So, I booked a room through Airbnb after checking the reviews and pictures.<br>
                After reaching there, at my Airbnb, the room was totally, different from the pictures. The amenities mentioned were not there. I contacted my host. But I didn't got any reply till date. I contacted Airbnb telling about the situation, and after a few days, I got a reply the host is not replying to them either. I was living in a room with no A.C., no Fan etc. and the weather was so hot at that time. I decided to book another Airbnb, but I was scared at this time. What if this happens again?

              </p>

              <p> Then, this was for a temporary purpose. Airbnb was expensive. I have to find the room that fits my budget and is not much far from the school. I started looking for the brokers/agents, co-living spaces (expensive), etc. Setting up appointments with them, going to different locations, different time, some meetings are at the same time with different people.
                  At the same time, have to go to school for the classes, talking with classmates about their experience of finding rooms. It was pretty much the same.
                  <br><br>So, after my experience and observing people struggling the same and having the same experience, I thought of surveying just a simple question.</p>
              <p>
              <p><img src="work4/img1.jpg" alt="" /></p>
              <p>
                <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                So, from the above survey, it clears that the problem is still out there, which these websites are not able to solve.
These website, have images, details, but no rooms in budget. Some have a budget but no images/features of the room — no contact information.
If you chose, to find room with the help of broker or agents, then you have to pay broker fees (most of the time) which is one month rent in most cases.
<strong>So, I can ease this hustle of finding a room!</strong>
