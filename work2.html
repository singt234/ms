                <h3>RECAP:</h3> 
                  So, After finalising the idea, we did our <a href="work1.html"><u>Prototyping-I.</u></a> In which we use ipad to run the concept i.e. <i>googly 
                  eyes following you as you pass through that lamp post.</i> After getting some interactions from kids there, we made this 
                  as a product that can be installed at the location and we can record the interactions.
              </p>
              <p><img src="work2/img1.gif" loop="infinite" alt="" /></p>
              <p><h3>Process:</h3>
                <h4>Step 1</h4>
                We had the concept in our mind, all we had to do was to make it real. This started with <b>Laser Cutting</b>. We laser cut the acrylic board to the structure needed for the eyes and the setup.
                <p><img src="work2/img2.gif" loop="infinite" alt="" /></p>
              </p>
              <p>
                <h4>Step 2</h4>
                So, we got the black acrylic board, so we needed the white part of the eye. So, we did white <b>Spray Painting</b> on the black acrylic board so that we can have our eyes ready.
              </p>
              <p><img src="work2/img3.gif" loop="infinite" alt="" /></p>
              <p>
                <h4>Step 3</h4>
                After we had all the necessary things to made the structure, we started assembling it. After assembling, we had something that we can test on.
              </p>
              <p><img src="work2/img4.gif" alt="" /></p>
              <p>
                <h3>Testing</h3>
                We had our working project after hours of hard work. It was time to test the product and our hard work. It worked!
              </p>
              <p><img src="work2/img5.gif" alt="" /></p>
              <p>
                <h3>Final</h3>
                After successful run during testing stage, we installed it at our location (Irving Square Park, Bushwick). Here is the short video of people reacting to the product:
              </p>

              <p>
                <h3>Problems Faced:</h3>
                We faced couple of problems, during our prototyping at park which we are going to resolve and might come up with a better product.<br><br>
                1. The product was heavy to hang it with the rope on lamp pole, so we have to hold it during prototyping.<br>
                2. The eye on the right side(of user) was not working perfectly. It was a mechanical failure.<br>
                3. People were not passing through the pathway, as I were holding and standing, so they thought I am performing some activity.<br>
                4. Not every people who were passing were noticing the eyes(product).<br>
                5. Sometime eyes were not able to detect someone passing through.
              </p>

              <p>
                <h3>What's Next?</h3>
               After all the problems faced, we are going to try something new with our product like:<br><br>
                1. Probably new location in the park, or maybe new Lamp post.<br>
                2. Improved mechanical stability to stare/follow people better.<br>
                3. Improved detection algorithm, so we didn't miss anyone.
