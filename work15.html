            <h2>A. What are the specific questions you are attempting to answer in your prototypes?</h2>
            <p>
              Some questions that were raised in the feedback that I received on my prototype and I am attempting to
              answer the same.<br>
              1. Why would people be interested in looking for properties via my website when there already exist a
              handful of such websites in the market?<br>
              2. What is the different strategy involved that makes house hunting easy and reliable from my portal?<br>
              3. What does it have special for students in it?<br>
              4. How can I develop trust in people through screens or digital media?
              <br></p>
            <h2>B. What the five strengths of your project?</h2>
            <p>
              Following are the strengths of my project:<br>
              1. Any property that will be listed on my portal will be 100 percent verified, meaning there'll be no
              fraud or discrepancy around the property. Also, providing the personal assistant to the students.<br>
              2. Each listing is supported with statistics about the property and area, example crime rate of the
              neighbourhood and gestimate.<br>
              3. It also lists available essential leads near by for example, distance and route to your work place,
              information about near by schools and hospitals to make the decision making process easier.<br>
              4. Provides the facility to contact the owner and get more information about it and also connect with
              previous tenants.<br>>
              5. Provides 3D and virtual tour of the place to get the look and feel of the same.<br>
            </p>
            <h2>C. What are the five most critical issues for your project?</h2>
            <p>
              Following are the critical issues of my project:<br>
              1. To be able to gather authentic data and perform a background check on each of the new listings.<br>
              2. To be able to best describe the property from best pictures and virtual tour of the place.<br>
              3. Give best statistics and information on near by resources.<br>
              4. To allow only genuine buyers to contact the owner or previous tenants.<br>
              5. To be able to provides best deals and pocket friendly prices for students.<br>
            </p>
            <h2>D. What can you do to address these issues, and to solidify the strengths?</h2>
            <p>
              1. Will arrange a team of people who will personally go and visit the property and verify the listing and
              perform background checks.<br>
              2. The same team will capture first hand good quality images of the place as well as record the virtual
              tour with the help of 360 degree.<br>
              3. There are a lot of good and open source information platforms that give statistics information and good
              resource information. To tie up and get best leads will help address this issue.<br>
              4. The interested buyers will show interest on the platform and then will be matched with the owners and
              tenants. The same information will not be openly available.<br>
              5. This will require to run drives and collaborate will others to be able to deliver best deals for
              students.<br> 
              6. Collaborating with the real estate companies and matterport - that will help in making virtual tour and
              3D model effective and ease with reducing the cost. <br> 
            </p>
            <h2>E. What new questions do you have?</h2>
            <p>
              As per the final feedback given by the collegues and external critics:<br>
              1. I am concern about the security issues that virtual tour can cause. What could be done to solve this
              issue?<br>
              2. How can I build community of people to trust these listings apart from performing the background
              checks?<br>
              3. What could be done to make the roommate finding easy for the students?<br>
              4. What could be done to solve the guarantor finding easy and without paying so much to the guarantors?
              What services should be provided to the students?<br>
              5. Can I collaborate with the OYO-Startup? That can help me solve the background check issue and might
              reduce the cost!<br> 
            </p>
            <h2>F. What questions need to be answered in order to create a proof of concept prototype?</h2>
            <p>
              As per the final feedback given by the collegues and external critics:<br>
              1. I am concern about the security issues that virtual tour can cause. What could be done to solve this
              issue?<br>
              2. How can I build community of people to trust these listings apart from performing the background

              5. Can I collaborate with the OYO-Startup? That can help me solve the background check issue and might
              reduce the cost!<br> 
            </p>
            <h2>G. How has this prototype allowed you to engage in your goals within this program? Does this feel like a
              possible future direction?</h2>
            <p>
              As we are learning in the program that we are to design products that will help benefit the society, this
              product is intended to help international students primarily easy the house hunting process. It involved a
              lot of research and behaviour study to understand the needs of the people and devise a model that will
              suit the needs of all. It required me to practice different disciples and learnings of my program.<br>

              I feel engaging virtual tours and 3D model is a possible future perspective to the field of property
              trade. I would also want to include a personal assistant and speech search to take this forward which
              might create a huge stir and be the future concept for the same.
