              This week’s prompt is about finding ideas for a project emerging from your initial research, your creative
              intentions, and your overall goals for MFADT. Use the following prompts to seek out opportunities for
              project-based continuations of your research. Try to write against at least three of these. <br><br>

              <i>Discover</i>: Look through different instruments or lenses at the PoV you’ve established around

              your topic.<br>

              <i>Scale</i>: Amplify, Expand or Condense components/phenomena/actions already present. What

              happens if you scale your ideas up or down?<br>

              <i>Name</i>: Determine an individual member of a specific public and work just for them.<br>

              <i>Narrate</i>: Determine actors and plot points and construct a story...and fill in the parts that are

              missing. Consider myth, drama, mystery, comedy—fiction can be as strong as fact.<br>

              <i>Problematize</i>: Instead of solving a problem, make a problem/challenge visible and physical<br>
            </p>
            <p><img src="Lectures/work6.jpg" alt="" /></p>
            <h5>1. Discover:</h5>
            </p>
            <p>
              So, in the last prompt, I discovered my research question. My research question is how to make searching
              place, rooms, houses easy for every user?

            </p>
            <br><br>
            <h5>2. Narrative/Problematize:</h5>
            <p>
              So, when I got accepted at parsons, one of the crucial task is to find a place to live. I started looking
              for accommodations before coming to New York. I did what every person would do. Contact friends, friends
              of friends, joined facebook groups, made account on every possible website, which helps in finding
              room.<br>
              But no luck. It's not that I didn't like any of the listings. I contacted many people and got a reply from
              some of them. But they were all scams. People were sending me phishing pages, asking for a security
              deposit without me looking at the space.<br>
              So I decided to book an Airbnb for a month and continue my search in the meantime. After reaching here, I
              went to my Airbnb, and what I got the place was different from the pictures and amenities mentioned were
              not there.
            </p>
            <br><br>
            <h5>3. Name:</h5>
            <p>
              My problem is targeted to a specific audience. My particular audience is international students who go
              through this problem. I interviewed many international students and got to know about their side. What
              challenges did they face? How did they overcome them? What kind of solution are they looking for?
            </p>
            <br><br>
            <h5>4. Scale:</h5>
            <p>
              I want to expand my specific question to all the people looking for a space. Not only rooms or only for
              international students, but in a broader context, I would like to make it easy for every user who is
              looking for any space. Whether it's a businessman looking for a space to organize events or conferences or
              a person shifting to another state or country because of job.
