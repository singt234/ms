                <h3>RECAP:</h3> 
                  So, After finalising the idea, we did our <a href="work1.html"><u>Prototyping-I</u></a>. In which we use ipad to run the concept i.e. <i>googly 
                  eyes following you as you pass through that lamp post.</i> After getting some interactions from kids there, we made this 
                  as a product that can be installed at the location and we can record the interactions. We installed the product but faced some problems which we overcame in <a href="work2.html"><u>Prototyping-II</u></a>.
              </p>
              <p><img src="work3/img1.jpg" alt="" /></p>
              <p><h3>Changes done:</h3>
                <h4>1. Better Algorithm</h4>
                We worked on our previous algorithm and made it better to detect everyone that comes in the frame so that, we can have better results and more interactions.
                <p><img src="work3/img2.gif" loop="infinite" alt="" /></p>
              </p>
              <p>
                <h4>2. Sound</h4>
                Also, we installed a speaker with our product to get more interactions. When someone passes through and it detects someone it generates/make a random sound from the list of sounds we provided. <i>(We provided "Mario Game" sounds to this project)</i>
              </p>
              <p><img src="work3/img3.jpg"  alt="" /></p>
              <p>
                <h4>3. New Location</h4>
               We change our location from previous lamp post to another one which is near the kids-play area and to one of the most entrance used.So, now we can the interactions of the adults and kids both. It was a great decision for us. This location turned out to be the better than the previous one.
              </p>
              <p><img src="work3/img4.jpg" alt="" /></p>
              <p>
                <h4>4. Handsfree Installation</h4>
               We were finally able to install the product(Googly eyes) on the lamp post. No more standing and holding it. We used a solid hook and paste it with a strong double-sided tape. Also, we installed it at lower height than before, to make it easy interactable for kids and noticeable for adults.
              </p>
              <p><img src="work3/img5.jpg" alt="" /></p>
              <p>
                <h3>Finally</h3>
                After all these changes we got a great result. We got <strong>100+</strong> interactions in <strong>2-3 hours</strong>. Here is the short video of people reacting to the product:
              </p>
              <p><iframe width="620" height="345" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UbZJ1H3URPI" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
              <p>
                <h3>Observations</h3>
                We observed various reactions of kids and adults passing through. Number of reactions we got were very contrasting. <br><br>
                1. We got reactions such as curious, weird, funny, interesting, exciting, confusing, playful and many more.<br>
                2. Not every people who were passing were noticing the eyes(product).<br>
                3. Sound was not that much noticeable as this new location was noisy being the kids-play area nearby.
              </p>

              <p>
                <h3>What's Next?</h3>
                After a great response from this interaction, we are thinking to install at a totally different location. Possibily making this into a permanent self contained interactive installation with minimal 
                or zero maintenance.
                 <br>A reliable and better version fabricated with a better material choice. 
                 Also, installing it not only on a single pole but on multiple poles in a row so it creates a more intense following 
                 effect and possibly convey the idea of "government surveillance" to adults while being a fun play installation for kids.
