              I am more explicit about the idea and problem after the feedback from the critics. To be very real, I was
              focusing on the things I wanted to focus on. There were some things that people I interviewed mentioned in
              their interview. I picked out the things I wanted to listen or hear. But, If I explore that other
              side/things, maybe I should get something more exciting and innovative.
            </p>
            <p><img src="work6/img1.gif" alt="" /></p>
            <p>
              After reading the article "Changing Perspective," I realized that I am precisely doing the things that I
              shouldn't be doing. Also, talking to Harpreet, after the presentation that day, he told me the same
              things.<br>
              And after reading the articles and feedback from the critics. I was asking question to myself, why
              companies like Airbnb haven't tried technologies like Augmented Reality and Virtually Reality on their
              sites?<br>
              It's not like they haven't thought of it yet. Then what can be the problem? Is it about the experience of
              the user? Or it won't help the user in any way? But from the point I am thinking, is like 3D experience
              gives better insights as compared to 2D images. But maybe not in this case. Perhaps it won't solve any
              problem here?

            </p>
            <p>
              After the feedback, I also give a thought about the problem! I am trying to solve so many problems. Maybe
              I should focus on one at a time? Should I focus on solving the trust problems or help them visualizing
              better? What is the major challenge faced by international students? How can I provide them the insights
              and information or internal network of the place they are going? In my case: New york.
            </p>
            <p>
              I checked <a href="https://www.listingsproject.com">listingsProject</a> by Stephanie Diamond, as mentioned
              in feedback, and I tried to understand the
              way they are solving the problem. In Listing Project, they are sending the list of available spaces, like
              a weekly newsletter. But how they are getting the listings? How people get to know about them? How people
              coming to New York, or the places they have listings for will get to know about them? These were some of
              the questions I was thinking of when I was reading about them.
            </p>
            <p>
              After all this, I am researching the offline way to solve this problem, like building the community and
              making connections between people so that may help people to find the place. I am not sure how to pursue
              this or what things to keep in mind. I am exploring the ways/ideas that can be done to solve this problem
              — not thinking about the technology anymore, focusing on the issue of building trust among people. How can
              I make people trust that listing? How people used to find places when there were no websites/technology?
            </p>
            <p>
              I thought about the 90's time, how did you get to know about the place where we are living right now? Have
              you ever used the website to find the site? How were the times when there were so less real estates or
              brokers were there? How my grandfather used to find the place? People were putting the board/big posters
              on the property, mentioning this space available for rent with a phone number of the person to contact.
            </p>
            <p><img src="work6/img2.gif" alt="" /></p>
            <p>
              Moreover, I am trying to connect with Stephanie Diamond to know the thought process behind the
              <a href="https://www.listingsproject.com">ListingsProject.</a> What were the problems she was facing? How
              is she getting the listings? How she came up
              with this idea? Also, I thought about whether this kind of approach will solve my problem or not?
              I am going to research more on the things done in the past and present to make the future.
